Bonjour Paris!

I am so excited to share with you that we (my GF Inès and me) have **moved to Paris**!

Paris is always our dream city, it's still a bit unreal to see that we are actually here! Here I am going to share with you some of our life updates and what would they mean to us.

## Thanks

At the very first, I need to give a **HUGE thanks** to my company [**NuxtLabs**](https://nuxtlabs.com/) and my colleagues. They made all this possible and helped us a lot along the way.

And also thanks to every one of you. It's your support that helps me find my work valuable and continue working on them. You couldn't imagine my mom and my friends' reactions when I first told them my journey of getting a career by typing on the keyboard at home - the magic of Open Source and the communities! More than that, I got to know so many of you - my friends, colleagues, teams, contributors, followers or fans. All of these really changed our life, thank you!

## Life

Before coming to France, we were digital nomads for 1.5 years in China. It was a really special experience for us, that we also been through quite a lot of ups and downs. It's fun and fresh to wake up in different places every day, but it also comes with a lot of challenges and trade-offs. You got to get familiar with the new environment every day, and meet new friends but also need to say goodbye very soon.

This time we are going to stay in Paris for a long while. Learning the language, exploring the city, meeting new people and getting a cozy home. It's a new chapter for us, we are so excited about it!

## Photography

I was quite passionate about photography before I started working on Open Source. Since my focus shifted to programming, I took fewer photos, which is the thing I always feel a bit pity. I think this could be a good chance for me to get back to it.

Instead of carrying a heavy DSLR with lenses, I got a Ricoh GR3x that can easily fit in my pocket. Using it for a few weeks, I found myself becoming more willing to carry it and take photos every day.

I will share more photos on [my Instagram](https://instagram.com/antfu7/). You should also follow [Inès' Instagram](https://instagram.com/iiiiiiines__/), who is a real photographer! :p

## Travel

So happy the pandemic is close to the end, and I can finally join you in conferences and meetups!

Oh by the way, **I am going to [Vue Amsterdam on February 9-10](https://vuejs.amsterdam/) in person**! It would be my first-ever in-person speaking. I am so excited to meet you there!

Once we are settled down, we plan to travel around Europe and visit some of our friends. I will keep you updated on my [Mastodon](https://m.webtoo.ls/@antfu) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/antfu7), let's have a cup of coffee if you are around!
