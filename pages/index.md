Hey, I am river, a fanatical open sourceror.

Working at [<span i-simple-icons-github /> ConnectAI](https://github.com/ConnectAI-E).<br>
Creator of [feishu-openai](https://github.com/ConnectAI-E/feishu-openai), [gitmaya](https://github.com/ConnectAI-E/GitMaya), [others](/projects).<br>

I wanna make people's lives better, and I've chosen coding as my superhero cape. Because let's be real, saving the world is just more fun with a keyboard and some epic code, right?

Don't miss the show! Feast your eyes on the masterpiece list of [all my projects right here](/projects).

Outside of programming, I enjoy reading. Some of my reading-share can be found on [Douban](https://book.douban.com/people/151095889/collect). If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in wuhan), maybe we can hang out or read together.
